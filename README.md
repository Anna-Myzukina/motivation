## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create the starter Flutter app

- [ ] Open the IDE and select Create New Flutter Project.
- [ ] Select Flutter Application as the project type. Then click Next.
- [ ]   Verify the Flutter SDK path specifies the SDK’s location (select Install SDK… if the text field is blank).
- [ ] Enter a project name (for example, motivation). Then click Next.
- [ ] Click Finish.
- [ ] Wait for Android Studio to install the SDK and create the project.
- [ ] Replace code in your main.dart file with code below:

      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      void main() => runApp(
            MaterialApp(
              home: null,
            ),
          );

### Step 2 - Create a Stateless Widget
- [ ] Create a new Stateless widget called BallPage in your main.dart file.
- [ ] Replace the word null with the new Stateless Widget you created.

### Step 3 - Create a Stateful Widget
- [ ] Create a new Stateful Widget called Ball in your main.dart file.
- [ ] Instead of BallPage having a body of Container() replace it with your new Stateful Widget.

### Step 4 - Make it Interactive
- [ ] Use a FlatButton Widget to make the Image clickable.
- [ ] Add a print statement that gets triggered when the button is pressed. It should print 'I got clicked'.
- [ ] When you run the app and click on the ball image you should see the words "I got clicked" into the console like this:

### Step 5 - Randomise it
- [ ] Inside the curly braces of '_BallState' create a variable called ballNumber that can only hold integers (int), set it to equal 1.
- [ ] Instead of hard coding the ball image name that's being displayed on screen, use the ballNumber variable you just created instead.
- [ ] Add the dart:math library to your main.dart file.
- [ ] When the button gets pressed, use the Random() generator and the nextInt() method from the dart:math library to generate a new ballNumber between 0 - 4.
- [ ] print the ballNumber to the console when the button gets pressed.
- [ ] When you run the app and click on the ball image you should see random number between 0 - 4 printed in the console like this:

### Step 6 - Update the State
- [ ] Change the random numbers that are generated for ballNumber from 0 - 4 to 1 - 5 to match our ball image names. 
- [ ] Instead of using a hard coded image name to display the ball image that's shown on screen, use String interpolation and the ballNumber variable instead to make it show a random image.
- [ ] Use setState() to update the state of the image when the ballNumber variable updates.
- [ ] All going well, you should now have the full functionality of the Magic 8 Ball app, it should look like this:
